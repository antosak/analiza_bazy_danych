Original data contains daily weather data from the Global Historical Climatology Network for a weather station (MX17004) in Mexico.
The first column contains information about year, month, station id and measured variable name (maximum temerature in a day, minimum temperature, rain intesity), the rest of the columns contain the values of the variables for every day in a month as well as type of measurment (S or I). 
Months with less than 31 days contain missing values for the last day of the month. Values are given with one decimal place.
